# Aggregation
 Aggregation refers to the process of combining multiple items, data points, or values into a single entity or summary. In various fields such as statistics, economics, and computer science, aggregation is used to summarize large sets of data or to transform the data into a more meaningful representation.

For example, in statistics, aggregation can involve calculating the mean or median of a set of data points, which provides a summary of the central tendency of the data. In economics, aggregation can refer to the process of combining individual economic agents' behavior to analyze the behavior of the overall economy. In computer science, aggregation can involve the combination of different data sources to generate a single, comprehensive report.

Overall, the process of aggregation can help simplify complex data sets and enable better understanding of the underlying patterns and trends.

The program defines three classes: Instructor, Textbook, and Course. The Instructor class has private member variables for the instructor's first name, last name, and office number. It has public member functions to set and get these variables and to print them.

The Textbook class has private member variables for the textbook's title, author, and publisher. It also has public member functions to set and get these variables and to print them.

The Course class has private member variables for the course name, an Instructor object, and a Textbook object. It has a constructor that initializes these variables and a public member function called getAll() that prints the course name, instructor's information, and textbook information.

In the main function, an Instructor object, a Textbook object, and a Course object are created. The Course object is initialized with the Instructor and Textbook objects, and the getAll() function of the Course object is called to print all the information about the course.

Overall, this program demonstrates the concept of object-oriented programming, where classes are used to define objects with properties and behaviors, and objects can interact with each other to perform tasks.
