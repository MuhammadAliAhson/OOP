Distance class:
This code defines a C++ class named Distance that represents a distance in feet and inches. It contains two private data members feet and inches and a few public member functions like setFeets(), setInches(), getFeets(), getInches(), and overloaded operators + and - for adding and subtracting distances respectively. The class also includes two constructors, one with no parameters and the other with two parameters representing feet and inches. The constructors automatically convert excess inches to feet.

Matrix class:
This code defines a C++ class named Matrix that represents a 3x3 matrix of integers. It contains a private data member matrix and a few public member functions like setMatrixValues(), displayMatrix(), and overloaded operators +, -, and = for adding, subtracting, and assigning matrices respectively. The setMatrixValues() function takes a 2D array of integers as input and initializes the matrix. The displayMatrix() function prints the matrix to the console.

Product class:
This code defines a C++ class named Product that represents a product with a certain quantity and a serial number. It contains two private data members quantity and serialNo and a few public member functions like getQuantity(), operator =, and operator -= for assigning and subtracting quantities respectively. The class also includes a static data member objCount that keeps track of the number of objects created.

Date class:
This code defines a C++ class named Date that represents a date with three integer data members Day, Month, and Year. It contains a few public member functions like operator >, <, and == for comparing dates. The operators return true if the condition is met, false otherwise.
