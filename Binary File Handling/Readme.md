Binary File Handling




This code defines a Student class that contains information such as a student's ID, name, father's name, address, and CNIC number. It has constructors and setter/getter functions to initialize and retrieve the values of these attributes.

The code also includes member functions to write a Student object to a binary file and read a Student object from a binary file. In the main function, an object king of the Student class is created and its attributes are initialized. Then, the Write member function is called to write king object to a binary file named "text.bin". Finally, the Read member function is called to read the king object from the binary file and display its attributes using the display function.

Overall, this code demonstrates basic file input/output operations in C++ and how to read and write objects to a binary file. However, there are some potential issues in the code such as:

Using fixed-sized character arrays to store strings. This could lead to buffer overflows if the input string is longer than the allocated size.
Not handling errors that may occur during file input/output operations. For example, if the file cannot be opened or there is an error while reading or writing data to the file, the program will not handle the error and may crash.
Using the NULL keyword to initialize character arrays. In modern C++, the nullptr keyword should be used instead.
The Write and Read member functions take a Student object as a parameter, but they also belong to the Student class. It may be more appropriate to make these functions static, or move them outside of the class entirely and take a Student object as a parameter.
